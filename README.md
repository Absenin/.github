- ## 1 Device 1 Time Scan
  One device can only scan each QR once, so it cannot miss other people.
  
- ## IP and DeviceID Logging for Each Absence
  When other people are absent, we ensure that each absence is UNIQUE, making it safer.

- ## Multilevel Authentication
  Multilevel Authentication ensures that each user can have their own member, making it safer.
